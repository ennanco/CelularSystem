# Celular Morgenesis simulation System

This repository contains some of the code that I develop for my PhD thesis fromm 2005 to 2011. The system was a test in order to determine the posibility of using a similar system as the cells morphogenesis mechanism in order to addapt it in a computation model which can replicate different shape or even process information. Those desirable features was relaiability, redundancy and parallel processing. To some extend the thesis was a success but I abandon the develop due to other interest and the difficulty to publish this kind of material.

In the code as interesting points there is an implementation of a Genetic Algorithm with variable-length individuals, an implementation of a Cellular Automata simulator which can run in a single thread and keep the parallel coherence among signals.
